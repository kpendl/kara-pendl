<!-- <p class = "midbio">I received my BS in Business Marketing from the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse in 2008. After graduation, I joined yoga-retailer lululemon athletica where I got to dive deep into my leadership and personal development, goal-setting, life-innovating and all things yoga (this is also where I met my incredible business partner Mel!). </p>
			<p class = "midbio">In 2011, I decided to take my yoga practice to another level and completed Gioconda Parker's 200-hour teacher training program (the best 200 hours of my life!). Coming out of teacher training is when I was first inspired to build something that would support teachers both creatively and financially.</P>
